Chess

This project involves developing a fully functional chess game using Java. The goal is to create a desktop application that enables two players to play chess with a user-friendly graphical interface. The game will follow the standard rules of chess, providing features such as real-time move validation, checks, checkmates, and special moves (like castling and en passant). It will be designed with Object-Oriented Programming principles, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance.

The application will allow players to interact with the chessboard, displaying available moves when a piece is selected and restricting moves based on chess rules. To enhance user experience, additional features such as move history, game reset, and sound effects can be incorporated.

## Core Features:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): A clear and intuitive interface that displays the chessboard and pieces.
Move Validation: Ensures each piece can only move according to its rules, handling captures, checks, checkmate, and stalemate situations.
Game Rules and Logic: Implements all rules of chess, including check, checkmate, stalemate, castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
Move History: Logs moves for players to review or undo if desired.
Game Reset and Undo: Allows players to reset the board and start a new game or undo the last move.

## Extended Features (Optional):

AI Opponent: Add a basic AI for single-player mode with selectable difficulty levels.
Save and Load Game: Enables players to save game progress and load it later.
Replay Mode: Offers a playback option to review the game move-by-move.
Timer: Adds a countdown clock for competitive play.

## Technologies Used:

Java (for logic and GUI with libraries like Swing or JavaFX)
Object-Oriented Design principles for modular code.
This project will help reinforce your understanding of Java programming, object-oriented design, and GUI development while offering a challenging, real-world problem in game development.
